### Who am I?
I am a person who likes python. I started learning python about two years ago (2019).
I've been recently working on my discord bot [Hades](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=760182060542984203&scope=bot&permissions=940043318). It's built with the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library
I created this bot 3 months ago, and actually started developing it 2 months ago. It's suprising that I've gone from using .txt files and heroku to better platforms. It's amazing what one can do in a short period
